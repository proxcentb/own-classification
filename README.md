You would need to instal conda and pip dependencies on your own: <br/>
- torch
- torchsummary
- tqdm
- torchvision
- pygame
- numpy

```python generate_images.py``` - generate own images <br/>
```python prepare_data.py``` - sort out images and split in train and test sets <br/>
```python train.py``` - train neural network <br/>
```python test_predictions.py``` - draw something and hope that it is classified correctly <br/>
